Hello! And thanks for Trying out FixFusion!!!!ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
and when running FixFusion, Remember to run as admin because some functions will not work!
and the Shutdown and Restart are only working in WinRE, it's using the commmand utility"wpeutil".
This was a Very Hard Project, also ChatGPT Helped me along the way. So Huge thanks for ChatGPT!
Note: DO NOT SEPARATE THIS FILE FROM THE "Windows Logon.wav" FILE BECAUSE THE STARTUP SOUND WOULD NOT WORK!
Fix Fusion Might trigger windows defender Smart screen but it's because Windows Does not know this app but Click More info and click Run anyway
Anyway, Thanks again for using this Project!
